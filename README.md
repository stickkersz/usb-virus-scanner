# Installation

Pick the one that fits you.

## 1. Employees — install from the one setup file (easiest)

Your IT team gives you **`USBVirusScannerSetup.exe`**. Nothing else needed.

1. **Double-click** `USBVirusScannerSetup.exe`.
2. If Windows shows "Windows protected your PC", click **More info → Run anyway**.
3. Click **Yes** at the admin prompt.
4. Tick the options you want (defaults are fine):
   - ☑ Create a desktop shortcut
   - ☑ Auto-scan every USB drive on insert (recommended)
5. Click **Install → Finish**.

Done. The scanner, the virus engine, and the virus database all install from
that single file. A **USB Virus Scanner** icon appears on your desktop.

## 2. IT — build the one setup file

Do this once on a Windows machine, then hand the result to everyone.

**Step 1 — install the two prerequisites:**
[Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (tick "Add to PATH" during
install) and [Inno Setup 6](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php).

**Step 2 — verify the prerequisites (in PowerShell):**

```powershell
python --version        # expect Python 3.9 or newer
iscc /?                 # Inno Setup; if "not recognized", install it and reopen PowerShell
```

**Step 3 — get the code:**

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/stickkersz/usb-virus-scanner.git
cd usb-virus-scanner
# already cloned? just update:  git pull
```

**Step 4 — build the installer:**

```powershell
# Fully offline installer (employees need no internet) — recommended.
# The first run downloads ClamAV + the virus DB (~450 MB, one time).
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build\build.ps1 -Offline

# ...or a smaller installer that downloads ClamAV during each install:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build\build.ps1
```

The build prints `[0/3] … [3/3]` and ends with
`DONE. Installer: Output\USBVirusScannerSetup.exe`.

**Result:** **`Output\USBVirusScannerSetup.exe`** — the single file to deploy.

**Step 5 — smoke-test the build (harmless EICAR test file):**

```powershell
python tests\make_eicar.py C:\temp\eicartest
"C:\Program Files\USBVirusScanner\usbscan.exe" scan C:\temp\eicartest
```

Expect `Verdict : THREATS FOUND` (exit code 1). That confirms the bundled
ClamAV engine + database detect real signatures. Then plug in a USB stick to
confirm auto-scan-on-insert fires.

**Step 6 — deploy silently across the fleet** (SCCM / Intune / GPO):

```powershell
USBVirusScannerSetup.exe /VERYSILENT /NORESTART
```

<sub>Build troubleshooting: `iscc not recognized` → install Inno Setup 6 and
reopen PowerShell. `fetch-vendor.ps1` download fails → pass a current version,
e.g. `build\fetch-vendor.ps1 -Version 1.4.2`, or drop a ClamAV portable build
into `vendor\ClamAV\` manually. PyInstaller "module not found" → add it to
`hidden` in `build\usb_virus_scanner.spec`.</sub>

## 3. Install from source (dev / quick try)

Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Needs **Python 3.9+**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stickkersz/usb-virus-scanner.git
cd usb-virus-scanner
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

python cli.py drives          # list removable drives
python cli.py scan <path>     # scan a folder/drive
python gui.py                 # launch the GUI
```

ClamAV is optional here — without it, the heuristic + hash + YARA layers still
run (you'll see a "ClamAV not found" notice). Install ClamAV for full signature
coverage. (Windows one-shot installer for the source layout:
`powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install.ps1 -RegisterWatcher`.)

---

# Usage

## GUI (end users)

```powershell
python gui.py          # or double-click the desktop shortcut
```

Pick a drive (or **Browse…** a folder) → click **Scan** → watch the live
progress bar with **"scanning file X of Y"** and the current file name, then
read the colored banner (green CLEAN / red THREATS). Infected files are
quarantined automatically; **Quarantine…** lists them and can restore. Tick
**Report only** to detect without moving anything.

The UI is thread-off (scanning never blocks the window) and progress events are
coalesced — one redraw per tick — so even a drive with 100k files stays smooth.

## CLI (IT / fleet)

```powershell
usbscan drives                 # list attached removable drives
usbscan scan E:\               # scan a drive now (quarantines threats)
usbscan scan E:\ --no-quarantine   # report only, touch nothing
usbscan watch                  # auto-scan every USB as it is inserted
usbscan update                 # refresh ClamAV signatures (freshclam)
usbscan quarantine             # list quarantined files
usbscan quarantine --restore <ID> --to D:\recovered.bin
usbscan quarantine --delete <ID>       # permanently delete one (irreversible)
usbscan quarantine --purge             # permanently delete ALL (asks to confirm)
usbscan quarantine --purge --yes       # ...skip the confirmation
```

Exit code `0` = clean, `1` = threats found — usable in scripts / GPO. (From
source, use `python cli.py …` instead of `usbscan …`.)

## Prove it works (safe test)

```powershell
python tests\make_eicar.py C:\temp\eicartest    # writes harmless EICAR test file
usbscan scan C:\temp\eicartest                  # must report a detection
```

EICAR is the industry-standard harmless AV test string — every scanner flags
it, it does nothing.

# How it works

Five detection layers, each catching what the others miss:

| Layer | What it catches | Engine |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| **ClamAV signatures** | Millions of known viruses/malware, inside archives too | `clamscan` / `clamdscan` |
| **ClamAV PUA + heuristics** | Adware / potentially-unwanted programs, packed/broken PEs | `--detect-pua`, `--heuristic-alerts` |
| **Company hash blocklist** | Known-bad files from your own IR / threat intel | SHA-256 match |
| **YARA rules** | Ransomware, spyware/keyloggers, worms, trojan downloaders, macro droppers, packers — by *technique*, so novel variants match | `yara-python` |
| **USB + behavior heuristics** | `autorun.inf`, double extensions, ransom notes, encrypted-file extensions, packed/high-entropy executables | built-in |

## Threat coverage

Detection is designed around the real threat landscape — ~1.56B known samples
plus ~450k new variants/day. Known samples are caught by signatures; novel ones
by technique/behavior:

| Threat category | How it's detected here |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| **Trojans** | ClamAV signatures; YARA `Trojan_Downloader_Generic` (download+exec APIs); packed-executable entropy check |
| **Ransomware** | YARA `Ransomware_Note_Text` / `Ransomware_Crypto_API_Combo` (crypto + shadow-copy deletion); heuristic ransom-note + `.locked/.crypt/...` extension flags |
| **Spyware / keyloggers / infostealers** | YARA `Spyware_Keylogger_Indicators`, `Infostealer_Browser_Credentials`; ClamAV signatures |
| **Viruses** | ClamAV signatures (file-infector DB); hash blocklist |
| **Worms** | YARA `Worm_Network_Selfspread`; `autorun.inf` heuristic (removable-media spread) |
| **Adware / PUP** | ClamAV `--detect-pua`; YARA `Adware_PUP_Bundler` |

**Zero-days (the 450k/day):** the YARA rules match on *techniques* (crypto+VSS
deletion, download+exec, keylogging APIs, packer markers) and the entropy check
flags obfuscated binaries — so brand-new variants with no signature still get
caught. **Keep ClamAV fresh** (`usbscan update`, or the scheduled `freshclam`
the installer sets up) so signature coverage tracks the daily flood.

Two front-ends (`gui.py`, `cli.py`) drive one shared **`ScanEngine`**. A scan is
a pipeline:

```
   insert USB / pick target
            │
   ┌────────▼─────────┐
   │ 1. Walk the tree │  os.scandir, once. Collect path+size+mtime.
   │    (single pass) │  Apply max-file-size cap.
   └────────┬─────────┘
   ┌────────▼─────────┐
   │ 2. Cache filter  │  Drop files unchanged since last CLEAN scan
   │                  │  (path+size+mtime match) → candidate list.
   └────────┬─────────┘
   ┌────────▼─────────┐
   │ 3. ClamAV        │  Candidates handed to clamscan/clamdscan via
   │    signatures    │  --file-list (+ --multiscan). Parses "FOUND".
   └────────┬─────────┘
   ┌────────▼─────────┐
   │ 4. Heuristic     │  Thread pool. Per file: autorun.inf, double
   │    layer         │  extension, SHA-256 hash blocklist, YARA rules.
   │                  │  Deep read gated to risky/small files (fast mode).
   └────────┬─────────┘
   ┌────────▼─────────┐
   │ 5. Quarantine    │  INFECTED files moved off the drive, XOR-
   │                  │  neutralized, indexed for restore.
   └────────┬─────────┘
   ┌────────▼─────────┐
   │ 6. Log + report  │  Rotating log, JSONL for SIEM, text report.
   │    + cache clean │  Clean files recorded so next scan skips them.
   └──────────────────┘
```

A confirmed infection is moved to a neutralized quarantine (XOR-obfuscated so it
can't be double-clicked into execution), logged, and put in a per-scan report.
Everything is reversible via `quarantine --restore`.

**Removable-drive detection** uses the Win32 API (`GetLogicalDrives` /
`GetDriveType`) via `ctypes` — no service, no admin, works Windows 7→11. The
`watch` command polls for drive arrival and auto-scans on insert.

# Deployment & operations

## Fully-offline installer (zero downloads on the employee PC)

By default the installer fetches the ClamAV engine + virus database from the
internet (winget + freshclam) during setup. To bundle **everything** into the
one setup file so employees need **no internet at all**:

```powershell
# on the build machine, WITH internet, ONE time:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build\fetch-vendor.ps1   # ClamAV + signatures -> vendor\
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build\build.ps1          # bundles them

# or both at once:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build\build.ps1 -Offline
```

The build auto-detects `vendor\ClamAV\` at compile time: when present, ClamAV
and the full signature DB are packed inside `USBVirusScannerSetup.exe` and every
online step is removed. Re-run `fetch-vendor.ps1` to refresh the bundled
signatures. (`vendor\` is git-ignored — ~450 MB of Windows binaries, not
committed.)

The app icon (`build\app.ico`) is embedded into both exes and the shortcuts;
regenerate it with `python build\make_icon.py` (needs Pillow). Build artifacts
(`dist\`, `Output\`) are git-ignored.

## Fleet deployment

- **Recommended:** push `USBVirusScannerSetup.exe` via SCCM/Intune/GPO, install
  with `/VERYSILENT /NORESTART`. (Source alternative: push the folder + run
  `install.ps1 -RegisterWatcher`.)
- The watcher runs as a startup scheduled task under SYSTEM; every inserted USB
  is scanned automatically, no user action.
- Ship `events.jsonl` to your SIEM for company-wide visibility.
- Maintain `signatures/hash_blocklist.txt` centrally and sync it out; add hashes
  as incidents happen.
- Keep signatures fresh: schedule `usbscan update` (or `freshclam`).

## Updating an already-installed deployment

There are **two completely separate kinds of update**. Know which one you need:

| You want... | Use | Gets new features? | Gets newer virus definitions? |
|-------------|-----|:---:|:---:|
| Latest **virus definitions** | `usbscan update` | ❌ | ✅ |
| New **program features / fixes** (e.g. the delete button, GUI changes) | rebuild + reinstall `setup.exe` | ✅ | ✅ |

> **Key point:** `usbscan update` only refreshes the virus database — it does
> **not** add program features. New features live inside the `.exe`, so they
> only arrive by installing a newly-built `setup.exe`.

### A) Update virus definitions (fast, no rebuild)

Already automatic — the installer registers a daily task
(`USBVirusScannerUpdate`, noon) that refreshes the ClamAV database. To force one
now:

```powershell
"C:\Program Files\USBVirusScanner\usbscan.exe" update
```

### B) Update the program to a new version (new features / fixes)

You must build a fresh `setup.exe` and run it. It upgrades in place — the
installer has a fixed `AppId`, so Windows replaces the old files and keeps a
single Add/Remove Programs entry.

```powershell
# 1) On the BUILD machine — get the new code and build a new installer:
cd usb-virus-scanner
git pull
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build\build.ps1 -Offline -Version 1.1.0

# 2) On EACH PC (or push via GPO / Intune / SCCM) — run the new installer:
USBVirusScannerSetup.exe /VERYSILENT /NORESTART
```

Bump `-Version` each release (e.g. `1.1.0`, `1.2.0`) so the number shows
correctly in `usbscan version` and Add/Remove Programs. Omit it to keep the
current number.

**Kept safe across an upgrade:** the user's `config.yaml`, the Quarantine
folder, and the scheduled tasks (re-created). Uninstalling also keeps
Quarantine, so contained malware is never released back onto disk.

---

# Configuration & tuning

All behavior lives in `config.yaml` (ClamAV paths, quarantine dir, suspicious
extensions, workers, poll interval, speed knobs). Defaults are built in, so the
tool runs even if the file is missing.

## Accuracy — avoiding false positives on legit Windows files

Legit software can resemble malware to behavior heuristics: **signed installers
are packed/high-entropy**, and system tools import keylogger-like APIs. Three
trust signals quiet those false alarms — and **none of them ever hides a real
ClamAV, hash-blocklist, or YARA detection**; they only suppress the FP-prone
heuristics:

- **Authenticode signatures** (`trust_signed: true`) — a validly-signed PE from
  a trusted publisher (Microsoft, etc.) skips the packed/entropy heuristic. This
  uses Windows' own code-signing trust, so it works across builds with no list
  to maintain. The check is lazy (only runs when entropy is already high).
- **Trusted paths** (`trusted_paths`) — files under `C:\Windows`,
  `C:\Program Files`, `C:\Program Files (x86)` skip the entropy heuristic.
- **SHA-256 allowlist** (`signatures/allowlist_sha256.txt`) — exact known-good
  hashes are fully trusted (heuristic + YARA skipped for them). Populate from
  [NSRL](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ssd/software-quality-group/nsrl), your golden
  image (`Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256`), or add a hash whenever the scanner
  false-positives on a file you trust.

Precedence is safe: an explicit **hash-blocklist / ClamAV hit always wins** over
any allowlist or signature (so signed malware or a trusted-path implant is still
caught by the authoritative layers).

## Speed on slow laptops

- **Single tree walk** — the drive is enumerated once; ClamAV gets a file-list
  instead of re-walking the tree (was double disk IO).
- **Scan cache** (`use_cache`) — files unchanged since the last clean scan are
  skipped entirely. Re-scanning the same USB / hard disk is near-instant. Cache
  lives in `…\Logs\scan_cache.json`.
- **Fast mode** (`deep_scan_all: false`) — SHA-256 + YARA only run on risky-type
  files or files under `deep_scan_max_mb` (default 50). Big media isn't read
  byte-by-byte. Set `deep_scan_all: true` for max thoroughness.
- **Parallel** — `workers: auto` scales to CPU cores (capped so a single-disk
  laptop doesn't thrash); `multiscan: true` uses clamd's parallel engine.
- **Single-read deep scan** — a file's hash, YARA match, and entropy check all
  run off one read of the bytes (small files buffered once; huge files stream),
  instead of reading the file 2-3 times.
- **No redundant `stat`** — the cache reuses size/mtime from the initial walk.
- **Resident-daemon signature scan** — prefers `clamdscan` (ClamAV DB stays in
  RAM, ~10-100x faster on repeat scans) and auto-falls back to one-shot
  `clamscan` if the `clamd` service isn't running.
- **Skip archives** for extra speed on weak hardware: `scan_archives: false`.

Cheatsheet — very slow laptop: `deep_scan_max_mb: 20`, `scan_archives: false`,
`use_cache: true`. Air-gapped high-security box: `deep_scan_all: true`,
`scan_archives: true`.

# Development

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m pytest -q          # 45 tests: cache, quarantine, heuristics, engine, CLI, units
```

The suite covers detection correctness, quarantine round-trip (byte-exact
restore), cache invalidation, deep-scan gating, CLI exit codes, and config
merging. No ClamAV needed — the heuristic/hash/YARA layers are exercised
directly.

## Windows compatibility

Drive detection uses the Win32 API via `ctypes` — Windows 7 → 11 / Server, no
extra service. ClamAV and Python 3.9+ are the only prerequisites. On
Linux/macOS it falls back to mount-point polling so you can develop off Windows.

## Notes / limits

- Quarantine "neutralize" is XOR obfuscation to stop accidental execution — not
  cryptographic protection of the sample.
- Detection is only as good as the ClamAV DB — keep it fresh.
- Run the watcher elevated so it can read/quarantine files owned by other users.
