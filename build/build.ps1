    build.ps1  -  one command to produce the employee installer.
    Run on a Windows build machine (with Python 3.9+):

        powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build\build.ps1

    Steps:
      1. Install build deps (PyInstaller) + app deps into the current Python.
      2. Freeze gui.py + cli.py into dist\USBVirusScanner.exe and dist\usbscan.exe.
      3. If Inno Setup (iscc) is available, compile Output\USBVirusScannerSetup.exe.

    Result: Output\USBVirusScannerSetup.exe  -  the single file to deploy.

    Pass -Offline to first download+bundle ClamAV so the installer needs NO
    internet on the employee PC (runs build\fetch-vendor.ps1 for you).
