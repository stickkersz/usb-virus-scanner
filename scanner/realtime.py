"""Real-time file monitoring: scan files as they land.

Watches filesystem events (via `watchdog`) on configured roots, debounces them
(a big download fires hundreds of modify events — we wait until the file goes
quiet), then scans settled files in batches through the SAME ScanEngine
pipeline as manual scans. No second detection path exists.

`watchdog` is optional at import time (like yara): the module loads without it
so the rest of the scanner works, and `RealtimeMonitor.start()` explains what
to install.
